/**
 * Programmatic incremental compile delta (incremental delta).
 *
 * Exposes {@link compileDelta}: a library entry point that runs the normal
 * hash-gated compile and then returns ONLY the export pages that changed in
 * that run, instead of the full corpus. A caller (e.g. a downstream rule importer) can
 * poll this after each ingest and ship just the deltas to its downstream
 * store, without diffing the whole wiki itself.
 *
 * The change set is driven entirely by the compiler's existing
 * SHA-256-over-source change detection (`detectChanges` / `.llmwiki/state.json`
 * via `src/compiler/hasher.ts`). `compileAndReport` already returns the slugs
 * it (re)wrote this run on `CompileResult.pages`; we intersect those with the
 * freshly-collected export pages so the delta carries the same enriched,
 * provenance-stamped {@link ExportPage} shape the full JSON export emits.
 *
 * When nothing changed since the persisted state, `CompileResult.pages` is
 * empty and the returned delta is empty too — the "unchanged ⇒ empty delta"
 * contract the W5 test pins.
