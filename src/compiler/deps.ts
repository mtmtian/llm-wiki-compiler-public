/**
 * Semantic dependency tracking for cross-source concept sharing.

 * When multiple source files contribute to the same concept, a change in one

 *
 * Without this, if sources A and B both produce concept X and source A changes,
 * concept X would be regenerated using only source A's content — losing source
 * B's contribution entirely.
