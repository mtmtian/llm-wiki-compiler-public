/**
 * llmwiki viewer — declared field formats to external hrefs.
 *
 * The ONLY place the viewer builds a URL out of page content, which is why it is
 * its own module and why every branch fails closed. A profile declares the
 * FORMAT (`url`, `doi`, `arxiv`); the VALUE comes from a wiki page, i.e. from
 * whatever an author or a connector wrote. The value is therefore treated as
 * untrusted: a `url` must parse and carry an http(s) scheme, and a `doi`/`arxiv`
 * id must match a conservative grammar before it is concatenated into a resolver
 * path. The resolver ORIGIN is a constant here and never author-controlled —
 * that is the reason the vocabulary is a closed enum rather than a URL template.
 *
 * Returning `null` means "render this as text". That is the answer whenever the
 * guard is not certain, because a value shown as text is merely unhelpful while
 * a value linked wrongly is a live `javascript:` or an off-site redirect.
 *
 * Load validation already rejects an unknown format, and this guards anyway:
 * `/api/pages` is a wire boundary, and code on the far side of one does not
 * assume a validator ran on the other.
