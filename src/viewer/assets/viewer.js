/**
 * llmwiki viewer — vanilla-JS client.
 *
 * Three responsibilities, kept deliberately small:
 *   1. First paint renders the sidebar nav from an empty model
 *      (`renderSidebar({})`) so the chrome appears before any fetch settles.
 *      The server embeds no page data in the shell, so this is the only first
 *      paint there is — see `src/viewer/shell.ts`.
 *   2. `/api/pages` and `/api/health`, fetched once in parallel via
 *      `loadBootstrapData()` and cached in `bootstrapData` — fill in the
 *      sidebar's counts and lint badge, the header's whole-wiki verdict
 *      pill (which reads both), and render the dashboard home.
 *   3. Hash router. Home is `#/`; a page is `#/<directory>/<slug>`, where
 *      directory is `concepts`, `queries`, or any entity type the active
 *      profile declares; a profile type's list is `#/_type/<entity-type>`; and
 *      the static routes are `#/index`, `#/health`, `#/graph`, `#/concepts`,
 *      `#/queries`, `#/sources`, `#/reviews`, `#/workflows` and `#/pipeline`
 *      (the full set is {@link STATIC_ROUTES} — this list and that map are the
 *      same nine). Routes fetch `/api/page/...`, `/api/index`, `/api/health`,
 *      `/api/reviews` or `/api/workflow-runs`; the four list routes and the
 *      graph read the already-fetched bootstrap envelope and issue nothing of
 *      their own. The server returns already-sanitized HTML in `html` (see
 *      `src/viewer/render.ts`), so the client only has to set `innerHTML`
 *      and link up the support rail.
 *
 * No external dependencies, no client-side markdown rendering, no
 * inline event handlers — the spec's CSP only allows scripts from
 * `'self'`. The search-input wiring lives in `viewer-search.js`.
