 * one entity type. A default project declares no `profilePipeline`, so this
 * module returns nothing for it and the sidebar's fixed rows stand — which is
 * what keeps today's default sidebar byte-for-byte where it was.
 *
 * Split out of viewer-sidebar.js because the ORDERING and LABELLING rules are
