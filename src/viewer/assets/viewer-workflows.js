/**
 * llmwiki viewer — the #/workflows list route.
 *
 * A peer of #/reviews: same `.list-row` language, same empty-state contract,
 * and the same reason for living outside viewer-lists.js — the routes there all
 * render from the already-fetched /api/pages envelope, while workflow runs live
 * under `.llmwiki/workflows/runs/`, outside the frozen snapshot, so this route
 * is fed by a per-visit /api/workflow-runs fetch.
 *
 * The route exists for the PARKED runs. A run waiting on a gate approval or a
 * stage-output submission is a work item blocked on a human; a run that is
 * merely running or completed needs nothing. So a parked row is marked as such
 * on the row itself and names the CLI command that moves it. Naming a command
 * is as far as this goes: the viewer is a read-only snapshot with no write path,
 * and a button implying otherwise would be a lie.
 *
 * The command has to be the one that WORKS, which is why the row branches on the
 * classifier's hint fields rather than on the park flags alone: a stage-output
 * park names the declared `--kind`/type it submits against, and a `trust:` gate
 * — which no `gate approve` can clear — names the trusted-write grant instead. A
 * command that fails on paste is worse than none, at the moment a reader is
 * least able to tell why.
 *
 * A `problem` row (an unavailable or malformed run store) renders AS a problem.
 * The endpoint deliberately reports a broken store as a fail-visible row rather
 * than an empty list — dropping it here, or dressing it as a normal run, would
 * undo that and let a broken store read as "no runs".
