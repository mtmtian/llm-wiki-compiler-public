/**
 * llmwiki viewer — a typed entity page's DECLARED fields.
 *
 * The support rail's own list is nine fixed keys — `kind`, `sources`,
 * `confidence`, `provenanceState`, `contradictedBy`, `tags`, `aliases`,
 * `createdAt`, `updatedAt` — which is the DEFAULT profile's vocabulary. A
 * paper's authors, year, DOI and stage are none of them, so a typed page used to
 * show its body beside a rail describing a contract it was never under.
 *
 * This renders what the page's own type declares, dispatching on the declared
 * `FieldDef.type` and NEVER on a field NAME. That is the design constraint, not
 * a stylistic preference: a renderer that knew what `doi` meant would work for
 * one profile and quietly do nothing for the next, and `src/` may not name a
 * domain vocabulary at all (test/no-research-branch-in-core.test.ts).
 *
 * Three value states are reachable and no more. A record violating its declared
 * field contract never becomes a viewer page — `collectTypedViewerInputs` filters
 * it and it surfaces as a `field-violation` problem instead — so a rendered
 * field is either PRESENT, ABSENT-and-optional (the row is omitted, matching the
 * rail's existing rule that a sparse page shows a short list rather than a wall
 * of "(none)"), or an ARTIFACT REFERENCE this view does not resolve. There is no
 * fourth branch because nothing can enter it.
