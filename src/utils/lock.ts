/**
 * PID-based lock file for preventing concurrent compilation.
 *
 * Fresh acquisition writes the complete owner to a private candidate, then
 * publishes it with an exclusive hard link. A visible lock is never empty, and
 * the kernel guarantees only one candidate can claim the lock path.
 *
 * Stale lock reclamation uses a two-lock protocol:
 * 1. Exclusively publish a reclamation lock (.llmwiki/lock.reclaim) to serialize
 *    all processes attempting to reclaim the same stale main lock.
 * 2. Re-verify the main lock is still stale (another reclaimer may have
 *    already fixed it).
 * 3. unlink + tryCreateLock on the main lock — safe because we hold
 *    exclusive reclamation access.
 * 4. Release the reclamation lock in a finally block.
 *
 * The reclamation lock itself can become stale if a process crashes during
 * the brief reclamation window. When that happens, acquireReclaimLock only
 * cleans up the stale file — it does NOT retry acquisition in the same call.
 * The outer retry loop handles convergence. Recovery of a crashed reclamation
 * lock still has a legacy stale-read/unlink race with a third reclaimer; complete
 * owner publication fixes ordinary contention, not that separate recovery case.
