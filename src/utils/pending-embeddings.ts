/**
 * @file src/utils/pending-embeddings.ts
 * @description Durable write-ahead "pending embedding refresh" list, as a per-id
 * lifecycle.
 *
 * The compiler flushes source-state to disk (marking every changed source
 * current) and THEN attempts an embeddings refresh that SWALLOWS failures
 * (missing API key, transient provider error, or a crash). Without a durable
 * record, the changed page-ids would then have STALE embeddings while
 * source-state says "up to date" — the next compile detects no source changes
 * and the embeddings are never retried, a silent source↔embeddings disagreement.
 *
 * This module records the page-ids that need an embedding refresh to a durable,
 * root-CONFINED file BEFORE the attempt, and reconciles them AFTER. The compiler
 * DRAINS the list (unions prior-pending ids into the refresh set) on every
 * subsequent non-review compile, so a skipped/crashed refresh is retried even
 * when no source changed.
 *
 * ## Per-id lifecycle (not a flat id list)
 * Each entry is a {@link PendingEmbedding} carrying a FAILED-attempt count, so the
 * marker is a per-id state machine rather than an all-or-nothing batch:
 *  - A page-id that fails for a NON-transient reason (poison id) would otherwise
 *    stay pending forever, re-billed every compile AND wedging the all-or-nothing
 *    batch it shares. After {@link MAX_PENDING_EMBEDDING_ATTEMPTS} failures it is
 *    QUARANTINED (dropped + warned), so it can neither loop nor block healthy ids.
 *  - On SUCCESS only the ids actually re-embedded are cleared. An id that the core
 *    SKIPPED (transiently ineligible: orphaned/untitled/`includeInSearch:false`/
 *    profile-invalid) is RETAINED with an incremented attempt count — never cleared
 *    while un-embedded — until it embeds or ages out. See {@link settleAfterSuccess}.
 * The pure settle/merge/quarantine helpers live here for easy unit-testing.
 *
 * ## Backward-compat
 * A legacy flat `string[]` marker (or array entries that are bare strings) loads as
 * `{ pageId, attempts: 0 }`, so an old on-disk marker is migrated on read rather
 * than discarded. See {@link coerceEntry}.
 *
 * ## Confinement
 * Confinement is enforced at BOTH the dir AND the LEAF — confining only the dir is
 * not enough, because a planted `.llmwiki/pending-embeddings.json` → out-of-tree
 * symlink is a real LEAF that plain `writeFile`/`readFile` would FOLLOW out of tree.
 *
 * The DIR is resolved through the same trust-boundary resolvers the lock uses,
 * NEVER a raw `path.join(root, PENDING_EMBEDDINGS_FILE)` that would follow an
 * escaping `.llmwiki` symlink:
 *  - WRITE ({@link writePendingEmbeddings}) → {@link resolveConfinedPrivateDir}
 *    (mkdir; compile already created `.llmwiki`).
 *  - READ ({@link loadPendingEmbeddings}) / DELETE
 *    ({@link clearPendingEmbeddings}) → {@link resolveExistingConfinedPrivateDir}
 *    (no-mkdir; null on absent/escape).
 *
 * The LEAF is then hardened too:
 *  - WRITE goes through {@link atomicWrite} (`{ confineRoot: <realRoot> }`): a RANDOM
 *    `O_EXCL` temp written through the handle then `rename`d onto the target — rename
 *    REPLACES a leaf instead of following it, where a plain `writeFile` would have
 *    overwritten a symlinked leaf's out-of-tree target. `confineRoot` ADDITIONALLY
 *    fails CLOSED when the leaf itself is a symlink escaping root, so a hostile leaf
 *    is never written through. The `<realRoot>` is `dirname(privateDir)` (the
 *    resolvers return the realpath'd `.llmwiki`), so confine compares
 *    canonical-to-canonical.
 *  - READ opens the leaf with `O_RDONLY | O_NOFOLLOW` (a symlinked leaf → `ELOOP`,
 *    fail open), `fstat`s the HANDLE requiring a REGULAR file, and enforces a
 *    {@link MAX_PENDING_EMBEDDINGS_BYTES} size cap before reading — mirroring
 *    `openGraphFileRead`. The DELETE branch uses `unlink`, which removes the symlink
 *    ITSELF (never its target), so it cannot escape.
 *
 * ## Durability of the write-ahead intent
 * {@link writeMarkerConfined} DISTINGUISHES two failure classes that must not be
 * conflated: a hostile ESCAPING/symlinked leaf (correct to swallow, fail-closed —
 * a hostile leaf must never be written through) versus a genuine I/O failure to
 * persist the write-ahead record (ENOSPC/EIO/EACCES/EROFS — silently swallowing
 * this would VOID the durability guarantee this module claims). The escape is
 * swallowed silently; the I/O failure is SURFACED with a visible warning. Neither
 * throws — embeddings stay non-fatal to compile.
 *
 * The file is under `.llmwiki/`, so it is never emitted into `wiki/` output.
