/**
 * MCP (Model Context Protocol) server entry point for llmwiki.
 *
 * Exposes llmwiki's automated pipelines (ingest, compile, query, search,
 * lint, read, status) as MCP tools so AI agents can drive the compiler
 * without scraping CLI output. Read-only wiki views are exposed as
 * MCP resources for direct context injection.
 *
 * Transport: stdio. The server reads JSON-RPC messages on stdin and
 * writes responses on stdout, which is the standard surface area for
 * Claude Desktop, Cursor, and other MCP-aware clients.
