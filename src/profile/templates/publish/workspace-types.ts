 * @description Authoritative publisher workspace state.
 *
 * Two invariants are encoded in this shape and must survive every edit:
 *
 * 1. FULL HISTORY IS RETAINED. `followRotationChain` lets a client that skipped
 *    snapshots walk from its pinned key to the current key — but only if every
 *    later index re-emits the historical rotations. So every rotation ever made
 *    survives here and is re-emitted by every build.
 * 2. COORDINATES ARE IMMUTABLE. `coordinates` maps coordinate -> payload digest
 *    forever; the same coordinate may never resolve to different bytes.
