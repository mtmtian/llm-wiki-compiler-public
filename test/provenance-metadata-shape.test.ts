/**
 * Compile-time pin for the shared ProvenanceMetadata shape.
 *
 * Codex's post-merge schema-overlap audit flagged that ExtractedConcept
 * and WikiFrontmatter independently re-declared the same provenance
 * fields (confidence, provenanceState, contradictedBy), which was a
 * drift hazard. The fix composes both surfaces from a single exported
 * `ProvenanceMetadata` interface in src/utils/types.ts, plus drops the
 * duplicate private interface that lived in src/utils/markdown.ts.
 *
 * The two type-level assertions at the top are the strict guard: they
 * compile only when every key present on ProvenanceMetadata is also a
 * key of ExtractedConcept / WikiFrontmatter. Removing the `extends`
 * clause and inlining the fields would still pass — but DROPPING any
 * ProvenanceMetadata key from one of the two surfaces (the actual
 * drift codex worried about) would break `npx tsc --noEmit`.
 *
 * The runtime assignment tests below are weaker (every field is
 * optional, so an unrelated empty object would also be assignable) but
 * exercise the runtime field shape end-to-end.
