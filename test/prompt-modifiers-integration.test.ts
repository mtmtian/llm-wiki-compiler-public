/**
 * @file test/prompt-modifiers-integration.test.ts
 * @description Flipping a prompt modifier on an ALREADY-COMPILED project
 * regenerates its pages, end to end through the CLI.
 *
 * This is the behaviour the unit tests cannot reach. `detectChanges` classifies
 * a source by the SHA-256 of its bytes, so a second `compile` over unchanged
 * sourcesshort-circuits at "Nothing to compile" before any prompt is built — and a
 * newly-set `--lang` silently did nothing. The control that matters is a
 * SECOND compile whose sources are byte-identical to the first.
 *
 * The second suite covers the ways a run can regenerate LESS than everything.
 * The digest is one GLOBAL fact, so anything that narrows the work — a scoped
 * `refresh --stale`, or pending-candidate deduplication — can advance it past
 * pages that were never touched, leaving them current and permanently stale.
