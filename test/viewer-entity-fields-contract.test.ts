/**
 * @file test/viewer-entity-fields-contract.test.ts
 * @description The seam between the server's schema projection and the client's
 * declared-field renderer.
 *
 * Everything else about this feature is tested on ONE side of that seam.
 * `viewer-profile-schema.test.ts` pins what `buildPipelineEnvelope` emits;
 * `viewer-entity-fields.test.ts` pins what the renderer draws — from a
 * HAND-WRITTEN envelope. Both stay green if the two disagree: emit `fields` as a
 * map instead of an ordered array, or rename `name` to `key`, and the projection
 * suite passes, the renderer suite passes, and the feature is dead in the
 * browser with nothing red.
 *
 * So this file writes a profile, runs the REAL projection over it, and hands the
 * result to the REAL renderer as its `/api/pages` body. Nothing in the middle is
 * hand-written, which is the only way the contract is actually asserted.
