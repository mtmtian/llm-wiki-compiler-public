/**
 * @file test/profile-template-releases.test.ts
 * @description The shipped non-default templates' release lines, and the
 * retention that keeps every superseded release resolvable.
 *
 * Both templates gained a `titleField` per entity type at `0.2.0`; AutoSci then
 * gained `doi`/`arxiv`/`url` field formats at `0.3.0`.
 *
 * Neither template could title a page before this. AutoSci's `people` carries
 * `name`; newsroom carries `headline`, `name` and `reporter` and declares no
 * `title` field at all — so every newsroom page showed its slug on every
 * surface.
 *
 * Retention is load-bearing rather than ceremonial. `planTemplateUpdate`
 * resolves the INSTALLED release and compares its `profileDigest` against the
 * on-disk profile to decide whether a project carries local modifications, so a
 * dropped `0.1.0` makes `planBuiltinTemplateUpdate` throw for every project
 * still on it, and a `0.1.0` that silently gained `titleField` would report
 * every genuine `0.1.0` install as modified.
 *
 * Each `0.1.0` entity block is DERIVED from `0.2.0` by dropping the title
 * declarations, which are the only difference between the releases. The digests
 * pinned below are the ones those releases actually published, computed from the
 * pre-change source — so they are an independent check on the derivation rather
 * than a restatement of it. A later edit that leaks into a retained release
 * fails here instead of quietly mis-describing an installed project.
