/**
 * Unit tests for the Slice 3 graph neighborhood expansion.
 *
 * Drives `expandGraphNeighborhood` against synthetic `GraphData` /
 * `ViewerPage[]` inputs so every topology rule from the plan is
 * pinned in isolation: primary exclusion, ghost-to-gap conversion,
 * canonical-pair de-dup, depth-1 incoming + outgoing edges, depth-2
 * expansion + back-edge dropping, and the depth=0 suppression knob.
 *
 * Note on the "include incoming at depth 1" rule: a primary page A
 * with edges `A→B` (outgoing) and `C→A` (incoming) yields BOTH B and
 * C as depth-1 neighbors, because the plan §Graph Expansion says
 * `include outgoing and incoming links`. The cycle test below
 * documents this — C reached via the back-edge to A is depth-1, not
 * depth-2 (and is therefore de-duped if depth-2 expansion would have
 * tried to re-emit it from B).
