/**
 * @file test/trust-relation-write.test.ts
 * @description Tests for the trust-gated relation-write + lifecycle-transition
 * APIs (Phase 4 PR5) at the trust layer (no SDK facade).
 *
 * Relation writes route through the planner ({@link planRelationMutation}) and,
 * only when allowed, append to the PR4 store under one lock; lifecycle
 * transitions are a validated read-modify-write through the existing typed page
 * path, which re-runs the PR2 lifecycle gate. The fixture profile carries a
 * `tests` relation (experiments→ideas) and the research-lite `ideas` lifecycle.
