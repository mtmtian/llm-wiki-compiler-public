/**
 * @file test/relation-store-concurrent.test.ts
 * @description PROCESS-LEVEL concurrent-writer test for the append-only relation
 * store (spec 08 requires a real cross-process test for JSONL stores; FIX #13).
 *
 * APPROACH: spawn N SEPARATE `node` subprocesses, each importing the PUBLIC SDK
 * (`createWiki().createRelation`) from the BUILT `dist/index.js` (built once by
 * the vitest global setup) and appending K relations with DISTINCT endpoint
 * slugs (so content hashes differ and dedup never collapses them) against the
 * SAME project root, all at once. Because `createRelation` takes the project lock
 * with a BLOCKING acquire (prior commit 90b6952), the concurrent writers must
 * SERIALIZE rather than interleave.
 *
 * The verification reuses `readRelations`, which checksum-verifies every line and
 * FAILS CLOSED on any torn/interior record. So a green read with zero problems is
 * itself proof that no line was torn or interleaved; we additionally assert the
 * total equals N*K (none lost, none torn) and the header appears exactly once.
