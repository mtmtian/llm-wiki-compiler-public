/**
 * Mount the viewer's static assets into a JSDOM instance for DOM-level tests.
 *
 * JSDOM's `eval` does not drive ES-module loading, so every
 * `src/viewer/assets/viewer-*.js` module is wrapped in an IIFE, its named
 * exports collected, and the result registered on
 * `window.__viewerModules["./<name>.js"]`. Static `import` lines in each
 * module (and in the `viewer.js` entry point) are rewritten into registry
 * reads. Discovery is by directory scan, so adding a client module requires
 * no change here.
 *
 * `viewer-graph.js` is stubbed rather than evaluated — D3 is not exercised
 * under JSDOM. `viewer-theme-boot.js` is a classic script and is evaluated
 * verbatim before the modules, matching its `<head>` position in the shell.
 *
 * Test fixtures pass a fetch responder; unmatched URLs fall through to 404 so
 * a test that forgot to wire an endpoint fails loudly rather than silently
 * producing an empty UI.

/**
 * Modules whose evaluation order matters because they import each other.
 * Anything not listed here is appended afterwards in directory order.
 *
 * `viewer-format.js` has no imports of its own (pure functions, no DOM
 * access) but is imported by several other modules, including
 * `viewer-dashboard.js` — whose name sorts alphabetically BEFORE
 * "viewer-format.js", so directory order alone would evaluate the
 * dependent first and crash destructuring an undefined registry entry.
 * Pinning it here (like viewer-dom.js and viewer-theme.js) guarantees it
 * registers before any dependent regardless of filename.
 *
 * `viewer-rail.js` has the same problem for the same reason: the Nebula
 * skeleton restructure (2026-08-05) made `viewer-dashboard.js` import
 * `renderDashboardRail` from it — the dashboard's receipt/next-actions/
 * snapshot-note panels now render through the shared support-rail module
 * instead of a private `.dashboard-rail` column — and "viewer-dashboard.js"
 * still sorts before "viewer-rail.js" alphabetically.
 *
 * `viewer-pattern.js` has the same problem again: `viewer-dashboard.js`
 * imports `buildPatternStrip` from it (the pattern strip's dismiss/
 * persistence logic was split out to stay under the 400-line file cap —
 * see that module's own header), and "viewer-dashboard.js" sorts before
 * "viewer-pattern.js" alphabetically too.
 *
 * `viewer-stat-card.js` has the same problem a third time, on the Overview
 * dashboard: `viewer-dashboard.js` imports `buildStatCard` from it, and
 * "viewer-dashboard.js" sorts alphabetically before "viewer-stat-card.js" —
 * directory order alone would evaluate that importer first and crash
 * destructuring an undefined registry entry.
 *
 * `viewer-health-lint.js` is pinned for the same class of reason even
 * though it happens to sort correctly today ("-" precedes "." so it already
 * lands before its importer "viewer-health.js"): the health screen's Lint
 * panel is imported by `viewer-health.js`, and leaving that dependency to
 * an incidental property of ASCII ordering is exactly the bet this list
 * exists to stop the repo making a fourth time.
 *
 * `viewer-pipeline-model.js` is pinned on the same principle: the Pipeline
 * panel's reachability model is imported by `viewer-pipeline.js`, and it too
 * only happens to sort first because "-" precedes ".".
 *
 * `viewer-nav-types.js` is the fifth instance of the original problem, not a
 * precautionary pin: the profile-vocabulary projection is imported by
 * `viewer-lists.js` (for a typed list's heading and empty state), and
 * "viewer-lists.js" sorts alphabetically BEFORE "viewer-nav-types.js".
 *
 * `viewer-routes.js` is the sixth: the typed list route's namespace is imported
 * by `viewer-nav-types.js` (which builds the href) and by `viewer-sidebar.js`
 * (which matches it), and "viewer-nav-types.js" sorts before "viewer-routes.js".
 * It is listed above its own importer for the same reason.
 *
 * `viewer-dashboard-vocabulary.js` is the seventh: `viewer-dashboard.js` imports
 * the profile-vocabulary projection from it, and sorts before it.
