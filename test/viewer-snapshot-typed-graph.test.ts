/**
 * Integration tests: the viewer snapshot graph surfaces typed entity pages +
 * relations for a NON-DEFAULT profile (CLP 4b). This is the call-site wiring
 * proof — `buildViewerSnapshot` reads the profile's entity pages + relation
 * store and passes them to `buildGraphData`, so typed nodes/edges appear in the
 * frozen `graph` (which also feeds agent context expansion). A relation to a
 * missing endpoint becomes a ghost node without crashing.
