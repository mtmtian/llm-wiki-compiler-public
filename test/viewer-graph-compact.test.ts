/**
 * Compact graph mode.
 *
 * The dashboard panel renders a real graph, not a decorative picture, so it
 * shares one fetch path and one simulation builder with #/graph. Compact
 * mode is options-only — it must never become a second renderer. One test
 * pins full mode's own numbers (unchanged since before this file existed)
 * so a future compact-mode tweak cannot silently shift them too; the next
 * pins the opposite for compact — that its forces stay derived from panel
 * size and node count rather than drifting back to a fixed pair.
