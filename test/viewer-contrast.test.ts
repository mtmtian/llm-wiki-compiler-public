/**
 * WCAG contrast floors for the Nebula palette.
 *
 * The design mockup is a static image and says nothing about contrast, so
 * this file measures the shipped tokens against the stylesheets' own real
 * consumers rather than assuming.
 *
 * `--fg-ghost`, `--fg-faint`, and `--warn-muted` are the tokens most at
 * risk: every real consumer of the three renders at 9.5-12.5px (see the
 * per-row comments on MUTED_TEXT_CASES below), nowhere near WCAG 2.1
 * SC 1.4.3's large-text thresholds (>=24px, or >=18.66px bold). The
 * applicable floor for all of them is therefore the body-text 4.5:1 — an
 * earlier version of this file asserted the large-text 3:1 floor for these
 * three instead, which is wrong for every one of their consumers and let
 * the test pass while the real requirement failed.
 *
 * Measured against every background a real stylesheet rule actually puts
 * them on (2026-08-05 review), 11 of 16 (fg-ghost x2 backgrounds + fg-faint
 * x5 backgrounds + warn-muted x1 background, x2 themes) fail 4.5:1 at the
 * currently shipped token values. Fixing `--fg-ghost` or `--fg-faint` would
 * require moving each up to (or past) `--fg-dim` -- the next-brightest rung
 * in the muted-text scale -- which is a visible design change, not a
 * "smallest step" nudge. That call was escalated rather than made silently;
 * see `.superpowers/sdd/2026-08-04-nebula-viewer-ui/final-fix-report.md`
 * for the full before/after table and reasoning. MUTED_TEXT_CASES below
 * pins the CURRENTLY SHIPPED state -- including the known failures -- so a
 * regression (something gets worse) and a fix (something gets better) are
 * both caught: a "fail" row that starts passing flips this test red,
 * which is the prompt to update that row to "pass".
 *
 * `--fg-disabled` joined this file in the 2026-08-05 fidelity pass, when it
 * was restored to viewer-tokens.css (a prior branch had deleted it as
 * "consumed by nothing") and wired to zero-valued nav counts. At 10.5px on
 * --bg-sidebar it is well below 4.5:1 in both themes — a deliberately
 * near-invisible "disabled" treatment, pinned below like the other three.
