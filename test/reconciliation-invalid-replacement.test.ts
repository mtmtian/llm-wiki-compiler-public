/**
 * @file test/reconciliation-invalid-replacement.test.ts
 * @description A reconciliation whose replacement page fails validation must
 * stay repairable.
 *
 * Rebuilding a shared page runs extract, merge, generate, validate, write.
 * Validation lives in the renderer's CALLER (`validateWikiPage` in
 * review-pipeline.ts): an invalid body returns `{ error }` and no `liveWrite`,
 * so the slug never reaches `writtenPages`.
 *
 * Extraction succeeding is therefore not evidence the page was replaced, and
 * retiring reconciliation state on it strands the page: the last-known-good
 * body is orphaned, the surviving owner is recorded with no concepts, and the
 * marker is cleared, so the next compile has nothing left telling it to try
 * again. That is the terminal state reconciliation exists to end, reached
 * through the failure path instead of the happy one.
 *
 * A SOFT failure is the case that matters. A thrown provider error aborts the
 * run and leaves state untouched; an output that merely fails validation lets
 * the pipeline continue and retire state around a page that was never written.
