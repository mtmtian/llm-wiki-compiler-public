/**
 * @file test/research-workflow-denial-cli.test.ts
 * @description The G1 relation-precondition proofs (CLP 6.3), driven end-to-end
 * through the real `dist/cli.js` in subprocesses.
 *
 * Three proofs, all over the same workflows the headline drives:
 *  - EXPERIMENT DENIAL: the research pipeline with `link-experiment` writing a
 *    `tests` edge to a NONEXISTENT idea slug. The dangling edge does NOT count
 *    toward the `experiments.complete` precondition (it resolves to no on-disk
 *    page), so `complete-experiment`'s submit is HARD-DENIED — the CLI exits
 *    non-zero, the run ends terminal `failed`, and the experiment never leaves
 *    `stage: running`.
 *  - MANUSCRIPT HAPPY: a manuscript whose `cites` edge points at a real SEEDED
 *    paper reaches `submitted`.
 *  - MANUSCRIPT DENIAL: a manuscript whose `cites` edge is dangling is HARD-DENIED
 *    at `submit-manuscript` (non-zero exit; page never reaches `submitted`).
